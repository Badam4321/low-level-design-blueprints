## Object-Oriented Programming
Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there was a young girl named Anita who loved to bake. She dreamed of opening her bakery, filled with delicious treats and happy customers. But little did she know, her baking passion would help her understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
In her bakery:

- **Classes** are like recipes. A recipe for "cake" defines what ingredients (attributes) and steps (methods) are needed.
- **Objects** are the actual cakes she bakes using the recipe. Each cake can be a different flavor but follows the same recipe.
- **Encapsulation** is like wrapping the cake neatly in a box. Only Anita decides how and when to open it (control access to the cake).
- **Inheritance** is when she creates new recipes based on old ones, like "chocolate cake" from "cake," but with extra chocolate.
- **Polymorphism** is when she can bake different treats (cookies, cakes) using a common process (like "baking") but with slight differences.

### Components of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Low-Level Design (LLD)

- **Classes:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). For example, a Car class may have attributes like make, model, and behaviors like start() or stop().
  
- **Objects:** Actual instances of classes. Each object has its own unique data and can perform actions. For instance, a specific Car object has a unique make and model and can start() or stop().

- **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex systems by focusing on important details and hiding unnecessary information. For example, when interacting with a Car object, you don't need to know how the engine works internallyâ€”just the methods like start().

- **Encapsulation:** Combines data and methods into a single unit (object), keeping some parts private and only allowing controlled access via methods. This prevents accidental modification and ensures data integrity.

- **Inheritance:** Allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (superclass). For example, ElectricCar can inherit from Car but have additional features like chargeBattery().

- **Polymorphism:** Enables one method to have different implementations in different contexts. For example, a start() method might work differently for a Car and an ElectricCar, but both use the same interface.
